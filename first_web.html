Cyrus, the daughter of country music singer Billy Ray Cyrus, became a teen idol while portraying the title character of the Disney Channel television series Hannah Montana (2006–2011). As Hannah Montana, she attained two number-one and three top-ten soundtracks on the US Billboard 200, including the US Billboard Hot 100 top-ten single "He Could Be the One".

Cyrus' career accolades include entries on the Time 100 list in 2008 and 2014, MTV's Best Artist of 2013 Award, and placement on Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists Chart in 2019.[7] She is often cited as an example of a successful child actor-turned-singer.
